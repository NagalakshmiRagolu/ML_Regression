ðŸ“Œ Regression Project

This project is based on Machine Learning Regression Techniques. It focuses on predicting outcomes using both Simple Linear Regression (SLR) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) methods.

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
Simple Linear Regression (SLR):

Used to predict the salary of an employee based on their years of experience.

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR):

Used to predict the profit of startups based on various factors such as R&D spend, administration cost, marketing spend, and state.

The project is divided into two parts:

Backend (Model Training & Prediction): Machine Learning models are trained using datasets and saved for further use.

Frontend (User Interaction): Provides options to choose between SLR and MLR, input values, and view predicted outputs.

ðŸ”¹ Methods Used
